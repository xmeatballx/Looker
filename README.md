## A minimalistic cross-platform file browser built with Rust/SolidJs

After switching to a custom i3 window manager setup on NixOS as my daily driver, I found myself wanting to reach for a simple file browser on occasions where terminal commands lacked the visual feedback that I wanted. I have also been curious about app development with Rust for a while so this seemed like a perfect excuse to try out Tauri.
